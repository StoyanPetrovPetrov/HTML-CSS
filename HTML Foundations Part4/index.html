                    I am happy to join with you today in what will go down
                     in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.

                <p>
                    Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today,
                     signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 
                    This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves
                     who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. 
                    It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.
